## Per-turn issue declaration (mooladhara#131) — NON-NEGOTIABLE

Every assistant turn MUST begin with a leading tag as the first token of the first line:

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[#123]` | Work bound to issue 123. **The normal case.** |
| `[unbound]` | **WORK with no issue yet — a TRIPWIRE, not a resting state.** File an issue. |
| `[status]` | Not work: a status/progress/report answer. Legitimate, no issue needed. |
| `[chat]` | Not work: conversation, clarification, a question answered. Legitimate. |
| `[meta]` | Not work: a quick command/lookup with no work product. Legitimate. |

ONE primary issue per turn. A turn spanning two issues is a signal to **split the turn**.

**Why:** it converts issue↔work attribution from *inference* to *declaration*. Unbound work
is unbillable and untraceable. `[status]`/`[chat]`/`[meta]` exist so that non-work turns do
not have to lie (`[#N]` on a status query) or trip a false alarm — a convention people must
game is a convention they will ignore.

A Stop hook (`.claude/hooks/check_issue_tag.py`) enforces the tag's presence. It is
**advisory** — it warns, it never blocks.
